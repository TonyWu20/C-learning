## Two-Pointer

Two-pointer technique is commonly used to solve array problems very
efficiently. Whenever an array question deals with finding two numbers in an
array that satisfy a certain condition, either directly or indirectly,
two-pointer should be the first strategy that comes to mind. This method rules
out large numbers of redundant potential solutions.
